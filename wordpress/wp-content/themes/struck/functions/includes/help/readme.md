Getting Started
===============

Thank you for purchasing my theme. If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file, please feel free ask any questions on the online [Support Forum](http://support.themewich.com/discussions). Thanks so much!

Installation
------------

> **WordPress is required** 
> 
> To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress already installed. For information regarding the installation of the WordPress platform, please see the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).

Once wordpress is installed, you can upload the theme files and activate the theme. The theme files can be uploaded in two ways:

#### FTP Upload

Using your FTP program, upload the non-zipped theme folder into the **/wp-content/themes/** folder on your server.

#### WordPress Upload

First, unzip the downloaded zip file. Navigate to **Appearance > Add New Themes > Upload**. Go to browse, and select the zipped theme folder, called **struck.zip**. Click **Install Now** and the theme will be uploaded and installed.

Once the theme is uploaded, you need to activate it. Go to **Appearance > Themes** and activate your chosen theme.


Plugin Install
---------------

#### Required Plugin Installation 

The theme's functionality is broken up through the use of individual plugins. 
This way, if you ever decide to change themes, your site data like shortcodes or contact forms 
will continue to work on your new site.

1. Once you have activated the theme a plugin notification should appear, prompting you to install the required and recommended plugins. 
Follow the prompt and click **Begin installing plugins**
![Alt text](../wp-content/themes/struck/functions/includes/help/images/plugin-prompt.png)

2. On the following page click the checkbox next to **Plugin** in the header. This will select all plugins. 
Only the plugins marked "required" are required for theme functionality. The rest are completely optional.

3. Next, select **Install** from the **Bulk Actions** dropdown and click **Apply** to finish the process. The plugins will automatically be activated.

#### Manual Plugin Install

If you've already installed the required plugins using the above directions, then you don't need to manually install the required plugins. 
However, if you've run into problems installing the theme's plugins, you can manually install them.

1. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**. Click the **Upload Plugin** link and then select **Choose file**. 
You can find all the plugins in your theme download in the **struck/functions/plugins** folder. Be sure to choose the zip file to install the plugin.

The plugin will unpack, install, and then require activation. Select **Activate Plugin**. Your plugin is now activated.

additional options that allow for even more flexibility. 

### Page Template Options
All Page templates have the following options listed below the content area, which allows you to customize the title

Frequently Asked Questions 
===========================

### What are Filters?

Filters work just like categories, only they are applied to both portfolio items and posts.
They allow these items to be sorted onscreen by the given filter. If you have a portfolio page, blog page, or you're using the 
[Posts - templates](#customization-customizing-pages-posts-template-options) to display posts and portfolio items then you can 
choose to use filters so they can easily to be sorted to display similar items.

### Where is the Homepage Template? 

This theme does not have a homepage template in order to make designing your website more versatile. For example, you 
could assign a contact page template as your homepage and add a number of sections and section slides to appear first before the contact form. 

In short, any [page template](#getting-started-page-setup-page-templates) can be the homepage, as long as you set it as such under **Settings > Reading** for the Front Page option.

Altering and Extending
======================

## Setting Up A Child Theme

By creating a child theme, you create a separate set of files that you can use to customize the theme without affecting 
the original theme. Not only does this make updating easier, it also makes sure that you will never ruin your original 
theme as you are never actually modifying the files. You can always turn off your child theme and fall back on the 
original.

#### Creating and using child theme
Whether you've made changes to the theme files already, or plan on making alterations, it's a good idea to create a 
child theme.

#### Adding additional CSS

Inside these child themes, you can see a stylesheet where you can add additional css styles to your theme. 

```css
/*
Theme Name: Struck Child Theme
Description: Child theme for Struck.
Author: Themewich
Template: struck
*/

@import url("../struck/style.css");

/* Add additional CSS here */
```

Simply add your custom css after the `@import` line and you're good to go!

#### Activating Your Child Theme

To use your child theme, be sure to zip it. Once it's zipped, you can 
[install it just like any other theme](#getting-started-installation). You'll notice that you can only activate the 
child theme while the correct parent theme is active.

#### Making Other Alterations and Additions

Adding additional CSS to the theme is great, but what if you want to edit some of the theme's template files, or add 
your own template files? 

This is where the magic of child themes come in. If you want to make a change to a specific PHP file in your parent 
theme, just copy the file and paste that copy into your child theme’s folder. Once you have the file into your child 
theme directory, you can edit away! WordPress automatically will use that file instead of the parent theme file as 
long as the child theme is activated. This method applies to creating new files as well.

**Important:** If you are copying files into your child theme, the file structure in your child theme should match 
your parent theme. For example, if you decide to edit a PHP file in 

```
/struck/functions/templates/sharing.php
```

you should place it in 

```
/struck/functions/templates/sharing.php
```

## Hooks and Filters

To make it easy to make alterations to the theme, we've set up a ton of hooks and filters you can use in your child theme
to change queries, disable features etc. Here's a giant list of all the hooks you can use with some examples to follow.
The general usage for these hooks looks like this:

```php
my_function( $data ) {
    // do some alterations to the data here
    // then return it
    return $data;
}
add_action( 'tw_section_classes', 'my_function' );
```


### Template Hooks

Template hooks allow you to add your own html content to the site via a child theme, without having to create child 
theme files. All the template hooks can be used in the following manner.

```php
function my_extra_html() {
    echo '<div class="note">Attention! Check me out!</div>';
}
add_action( 'tw_above_navigation', 'my_extra_html' );
```

Simply replace `tw_above_navigation` with the hook of your choice to change where the html will display.

Hook			                |Description
--------------------------------|-----------
**tw_above_navigation** 	    |Content to show up **above** the navigation.
**tw_below_navigation**	        |Content to show up **below** the navigation.
**tw_before_logo**              |Content to show up **before** the logo.
**tw_after_logo**               |Content to show up **after** the logo, but before the navigation.
**tw_before_nav_icon**          |Content to show up **before** the navigation icon, but after the top nav bar.
**tw_above_footer**             |Content to show up **above** the footer, and outside the footer content.
**tw_below_footer**             |Content to show up **below** the footer, and outside the footer content.
**tw_above_footer_content**     |Content to show up **above** the footer, and inside the footer content.
**tw_below_footer_content**     |Content to show up **below** the footer, and inside the footer content.

### Section Hooks

Section hooks allow you to alter section functionality via a child theme. You can add section or slide classes, ids, or 
inline styles. 

Example:
```php
my_function( $array ) {
    // do some alterations to the data    
    $array[] = 'another-value';
    
    // then return it
    return $array;
}
add_action( 'tw_section_classes', 'my_function' );
```

Sometimes you'll want to only alter a specific section on a specific page. You can do that by getting the id from the 
public `$post` variable of the page along with detecting the section number on that page.
                                     
Example:
```php
function my_extra_class( $classes ) {
	global $post;

	// only add class if the page id is 2 and we are on the second section
	if ( $post->ID == 2 && in_array( "section-2", $classes ) ) {
		$classes[] = 'an-extra-class';
	}

	return $classes;
}

add_action( 'tw_section_classes', 'my_extra_class' );
```

#### tw_section_classes

Add additional classes to a section. 

Example: 
```php
function my_extra_class( $classes ) {
    $classes[] = 'an-extra-class';
    return $classes;
}
add_action( 'tw_section_classes', 'my_extra_class' );
```

#### tw_slide_classes

Add additional classes to a slide. 

Example: 
```php
function my_extra_slide_class( $classes ) {
    $classes[] = 'an-extra-class';
    return $classes;
}
add_action( 'tw_slide_classes', 'my_extra_slide_class' );
```

#### tw_section_ids

Add additional ids to a slide. 

Example: 
```php
function my_section_id( $ids ) {
    $ids[] = 'an-extra-id';
    return $ids;
}
add_action( 'tw_slide_ids', 'my_section_id' );
```
 

#### tw_slide_ids

Add additional ids to a slide. 

Example: 
```php
function my_slide_id( $ids ) {
    $ids[] = 'an-extra-id';
    return $ids;
}
add_action( 'tw_slide_ids', 'my_slide_id' );
```

#### tw_section_styles

Add additional styles to a section. 

Example: 
```php
function my_section_style( $styles ) {
    $styles[] = 'an-extra-id';
    return $styles;
}
add_action( 'tw_section_styles', 'my_section_style' );
```

#### tw_slide_ids

Add additional styles to a slide. 

Example: 
```php
function my_slide_style( $styles ) {
    $styles[] = 'an-extra-id';
    return $styles;
}
add_action( 'tw_slide_styles', 'my_slide_style' );
```

### Post/Portfolio Query Hooks

Posts and portfolios use queries to get post info from the database. Using these hooks you can alter the query loops to
change them to your liking.

> All loops are stored in transients to reduce the number of calls to the database. If you plan on altering the loops,
be sure to turn off the transients momentarily or you won't see the changes take effect on your front end.

Example:
```php
// turn of the portfolio transient so we can see our modifications
function tw_remove_portfolio_transient() {
    return false; // turn it off
}
add_action( 'tw_portfolio_transient', 'tw_remove_portfolio_transient' );
```

#### tw_portfolio_transient

Turn on/off the portfolio transient.

Example:
```php
// turn of the portfolio transient so we can see our modifications
function tw_remove_portfolio_transient() {
    return false; // turn it off
}
add_action( 'tw_portfolio_transient', 'tw_remove_portfolio_transient' );
```

#### tw_portfolio_query

Change the portfolio query. Below is an example of adding posts to the page with an id of 341.

Example:
```php
// turn of the portfolio transient so we can see our modifications
function tw_remove_portfolio_transient( $loop ) {
	return false;
}
add_action( 'tw_portfolio_transient', 'tw_remove_portfolio_transient' );

// lets get recent posts and portfolio items
function tw_change_portfolio_query( $args ) {
	global $post;

	// we are only changing it for page 341
	if ( $post->ID == 341 ) {
		$args['post_type'] = array( 'portfolio', 'post' ); // add posts too
		$args['orderby']   = 'date'; // Turn off drag/drop order
		$args['order']     = 'DESC'; // Newest first
	}

	return $args;
}
add_action( 'tw_portfolio_query', 'tw_change_portfolio_query' );

```

#### tw_featured_transient

Turn on/off the featured loop transient.

Example:
```php
// turn of the portfolio transient so we can see our modifications
function tw_remove_featured_transient() {
    return false; // turn it off
}
add_action( 'tw_featured_transient', 'tw_remove_featured_transient' );
```

#### tw_featured_query

Change the featured query. Below is an example of removing the featured order and displaying posts in order of date on 
page 341.

Example:

}
add_action( 'tw_featured_transient', 'tw_remove_featured_transient' );

#### CSS Files and Structure

> **Always put your css changes in your custom css box or a child theme whenever possible.** That way, if you ever update your theme, you won’t lose your changes. However, if you have to edit the theme directly I’ve put all styles in one main stylesheet to allow for easier changes.

> **But wait! Won't all these plugins slow down my site?**

>This is a myth about WordPress commonly misspoken about running a lot of non-scalable, intensive plugins on your site. If plugins are quality,
>scalable plugins - they will not slow down your site. In fact, many of the top WordPress internet blogs run 50 - 100 plugins on their sites. 
>The plugins included with this theme were integrated with the theme in such a way so they are infinitely scalable, and won't slow down your site.
>In fact, many of these plugins will actually speed up your site!
